This is our Full Stack project 3. It is a movie junkies dream! With a simple search you can find virtually any movie in the world! Users are able to create an account and add movies to their "Watched List". By doing so users will earn badges from the movies they've seen before. Additionally they'll be able to add movies to their "Watch List" so they can keep track of movies they wish to see.
